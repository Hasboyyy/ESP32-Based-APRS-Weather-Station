# ESP32-Based-APRS-Weather-Station
This project implements APRS-IS (Automatic Packet Reporting System-Internet Service) and the MQTT protocol using an ESP32 board. The purpose of this project is to transmit measured weather parameters through these protocols using a pocket-sized, portable, cost-effective, and easy-to-build system.

The temperature and relative humidity are measured with a DHT11 sensor, air pressure with a BMP280 sensor, and solar irradiance with a BH1750 sensor. The system is also equipped with an RTC DS1302 module for NTP time backup and an active buzzer for notifications.
